# Personal Intelligence (Pi)

Recent Rise of Large Language Models we forgot to train our own model. In this project, we will build a model that can reflect our personality. 

We all have lots of communication data due to the large use of social media. But we donâ€™t use it the way it's used by a Corporation or Government. In that project, we will use it.

To mimic your personality we can not use others data. It will not make much sense.

There will be various ways of using your voice, and picture but we have not got into that for our current simplicity. 

We are going to make a NLP project that will give us a model that can reflect our personality.

## Gole of the project: 
### I want to Build A Personal Model That can Improve our Reply and bring personal development to our social life.

## Project Details :
Everyone holds a great deal of personal Data. We are not using it to build something personal that can reflect our personality.
This project is all about that. We will not share our personal data with each other, instead use that project to create an infrastructure
where we can put our data to train a model that can reflect our personality.

It will be the beginning of the Pi (Personal Intelligence) journey.

## What will be the final outcome?
This NLP Project helps us to train ML and Improve our capability to train Models.

## And how will this benefit anyone?
That will analyze the priority of the communication.
